/**
 * Demo geography for Cameroon (XAF) and Burkina Faso (XOF), both under
 * Africa, plus the ShopLocation rows that put the two demo sellers' shops
 * (see UserSeeder, users 107 and 113) into those countries — a shop has no
 * country_id column of its own; Shop::checkoutCountry() resolves it
 * entirely from productLocation()/serviceLocation(), both HasOne
 * ShopLocation scoped by type. Both of user 107's branches share the same
 * type and country (Cameroon), so they can't trip
 * ShopLocationService::conflictingCountryLocation()'s same-country-per-type
 * rule.
 *
 * Also seeds DeliveryPrice rows for both countries — without these, the
 * storefront's checkout can't offer a delivery option at all for either
 * demo shop (both are DELIVERY_TYPE_IN_HOUSE, so OrderHelper::deliveryPrice()
 * looks the price up directly by region/country/city, not by shop_id) and
 * the cart/checkout screens are unreachable past the shipping step.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT part of RegionSeeder. RegionSeeder is disabled (see
 * DatabaseSeeder) and populates the entire world from countries.json — a
 * separate, larger, previously-flagged-but-not-yet-decided change. This is
 * a small, self-contained addition of just the demo data this task needs,
 * safe to run whether or not RegionSeeder ever gets enabled: it looks up
 * every row by translation title before creating (same idempotency
 * pattern RegionSeeder itself uses), so it no-ops cleanly against a
 * RegionSeeder-populated database that already has these countries, and
 * never creates a duplicate Africa region on a second run.
