/**
 * Seeds a real, bookable service catalog for the two DemoAfricaSeeder shops
 * (Cameroon/501, Burkina Faso/502) — categories, services, and the master
 * assignments a service actually needs to be bookable at all.
 *
 * "Bookable" here means more than a Service row existing: Service::scopeFilter()'s
 * has_master check requires an active ServiceMaster row, and that master
 * needs both an accepted Invitation (see Service::scopeFilter()'s
 * ->whereHas('serviceMaster.master.invitations', fn($q) => $q->where('status', 2)))
 * and at least one UserWorkingDay row (->has('serviceMaster.master.workingDays')).
 * None of the three existed anywhere in this codebase before this seeder —
 * confirmed by testing against a genuinely fresh `migrate:fresh --seed`,
 * not just this dev database's own accumulated state: an earlier task's
 * manual, ad-hoc investigation had invited user 112 to shop 501 directly
 * against this long-lived dev DB, which looked like a real seeded
 * relationship until a fresh install showed zero invitations for that user
 * at all. Both masters (the existing global "master" demo user for Cameroon,
 * and a new one seeded here for Burkina Faso) get the same treatment:
 * ensureInvitation() and ensureWorkingDays() (the latter reusing
 * UserService::createDefaultWorkingDays(), the same helper the real
 * user-creation flow already calls) for whichever is missing either.
 *
 * img on every category/service is a real icon (see CATEGORY_ICONS), not a
 * photographic image — this demo environment can't source verified-working
 * photo URLs (Unsplash MCP isn't enabled this session, and unsplash.com
 * itself is blocked by this sandbox's own egress proxy, unlike flagcdn.com's
 * guessable, parametric URL scheme), so real icons from the already-a-
 * dependency remixicon package, served locally from web/public/icons/, give
 * a clean and reliable result without that verification problem. PR #74's
 * ImageWithFallBack fix still covers any category/service outside this
 * seeder's own six that's still missing an image.
