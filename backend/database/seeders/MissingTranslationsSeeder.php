 * A handful of keys the original template's translations.php/translations_en.sql
 * dump never included, found by auditing real screens rather than the dump
 * itself: three admin-panel Shop-edit step titles (confirmed via a live
 * click-through of Settings > Shop edit - they rendered as their raw keys)
 * and one storefront hero subheading (confirmed the same way on /home-2).
 * Both apps read from this one shared `translations` table (see the
 * existing 'shop'/'shop.edit'/'delivery' rows, group=web, which already
 * back admin-panel strings), so every key here uses the same group.
