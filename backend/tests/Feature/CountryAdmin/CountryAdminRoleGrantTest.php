 * Assigning a country_admins row must grant 'manager' when the user
 * doesn't already have panel access, or they couldn't reach the admin
 * panel at all (still gated by role:admin|manager). Removing that row
 * must revoke exactly that grant — never a role the user already held
 * independently — so a plain assignment-then-removal can't accidentally
 * leave the user an unrestricted global superadmin, but a user who was
 * already a superadmin before being restricted correctly reverts to
 * being one after the restriction is lifted.
