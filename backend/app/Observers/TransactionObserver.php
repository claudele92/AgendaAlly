/**
 * Records both directions of the fee ledger the moment a payment actually
 * completes, regardless of which gateway carried it — see
 * PlatformFeeLedgerEntry. Covers both Bookings and product Orders, which
 * share the same Payable trait and (for the fee side) the same relevant
 * columns (shop_id, currency_id, service_fee) - only the payable-on-
 * behalf-of-shop side is Booking-specific, since collect_via_platform
 * doesn't exist on Order.
 *
 * Most "paid" code paths (gateway callback in BaseService::afterHook,
 * the synchronous wallet debit in TransactionService::walletHistoryAdd)
 * work by calling Transaction::update(['status' => ...]) on a row that
 * already existed in some other status - a genuine updated() transition.
 * One path doesn't: CartOrderService::createTransactionByOrder(), used
 * for a multi-shop cart checkout, resolves the whole cart's payment
 * status BEFORE creating each order's own Transaction row, so that row
 * is inserted already 'paid' and never fires updated() at all - hence
 * the separate created() hook below, rather than just widening the
 * updated() class check.
